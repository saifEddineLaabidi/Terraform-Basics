# Challenges with Traditional IT Infrastructure

Let's consider an organization that wants to roll out a new application. The business comes up with the requirements for the application. The business analyst then gathers the needs from the business, analyzes it, and converts it into a set of high level technical requirements. This is then passed onto a solution architect. The solution architect then designs the architecture to be followed for the deployment of this application. This would typically include the infrastructure considerations, such as the type, spec, and count of servers that are needed, such as those for frontend web servers, backend servers, databases, load balances, et cetera. Following the traditional infrastructure model, these would have to be deployed in the organizations on-premise environment, which would mean making use of the assets in the data center. If additional hardware is needed, they would have to be audited via the procurement team. This team will put in a new hardware request with the vendors. It can then take anywhere between a few days to weeks or even months for the hardware to be purchased and delivered to the data center. Once received at the data center, the field engineers would be in charge of rack and stack of the equipment. The system administrators perform initial configurations, and the network administrators make the systems available on the network. The storage admins assign storage to the servers and the backup admins configure backups. Finally, once the systems have been set up as per the standards, they can then be handed over to the application teams to deploy their applications.
